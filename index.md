I am a Research Scientist specializing in Healthcare AI. My expertise lies in Anomaly Detection, Deep Generative Models, and Multi-modal Foundation Models, with a proven track record of translating theoretical research into regulatory-grade medical solutions.

Currently at VUNO Inc., I spearhead the development of neuroimaging diagnostics, focusing on modality-specific adaptation. Previously at MakinaRocks, I engineered production-level MLOps pipelines, optimizing latency for industrial deployment. My research has been published in top-tier journals, including Nature Communications, and recognized with the Pfizer Medical Research Award.

I am committed to building life-saving AI systems by combining rigorous clinical validation with robust software engineering.
