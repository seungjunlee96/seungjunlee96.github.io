Deep Generative Models (DGMs) are a pivotal area in artificial intelligence, focusing on approximating complex, high-dimensional probability distributions using neural networks. These models, when effectively trained, allow us to estimate observation likelihoods and generate new samples from underlying distributions, having applications in diverse fields from creating realistic images to assisting in scientific research in physics and computational chemistryâ€‹.

Generative models are transformative tools in artificial intelligence, revolutionizing how we approach data understanding and synthesis. 
They provide a probabilistic lens to view the world, enabling the generation, processing, and interpretation of various data forms, from images captured on our phones to complex social media interactions. 
This introduction aims to unravel the intricacies and applications of deep generative models.


## Understanding the Core Concept

At the heart of generative models lies the idea of viewing observed data as samples from an underlying distribution. These models strive to approximate this distribution, which is pivotal for downstream inference tasks. Parametric models, which we focus on, efficiently handle large datasets and encapsulate data characteristics within a finite set of parameters. The learning process in these models involves choosing parameters within a model distribution family that minimize the distance to the data distribution.

## The Challenge of Limited Data

One of the significant challenges in learning generative models is the limited data availability compared to the vast possibilities that real-world data can represent. For example, the plethora of potential images from a modern phone camera is immense compared to the size of even large datasets like ImageNet. However, real-world data often have inherent structures that these models can learn to discover, such as identifying basic features in images with minimal examples.

## Discriminative vs. Generative Models

It's crucial to distinguish generative models from discriminative models, like logistic regression. While discriminative models focus on predicting labels for data points, generative models learn a joint distribution over the entire dataset. This difference in approach opens up a range of applications for generative models, from data synthesis to feature extraction.

## Core Approaches in DGMs
Deep Generative Models are structured around key approaches like Normalizing Flows (NF), Variational Autoencoders (VAE), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), each with its unique advantages and challengesâ€‹â€‹.

- Normalizing Flows (NF): These involve constructing a generator by concatenating diffeomorphic transformations, allowing for the computation of the inverse of the generator and its Jacobian determinant. This approach is efficient in specific layer choices and aims to balance expressiveness and tractabilityâ€‹â€‹.
- Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNF): CNFs offer flexibility by defining the generator through an initial value problem and integrating backward in time. This approach hinges on the stability of the generator and its inverse, dictated by the design and numerical integrationâ€‹â€‹.
- Variational Autoencoders (VAE): VAEs address the limitation of unequal latent and data space dimensions. They use a probabilistic model for approximating the posterior distribution with a second neural network, leading to a variational lower bound or evidence lower bound (ELBO), which is then optimizedâ€‹â€‹.

## Evaluating Generative Models

Evaluating these models involves three key aspects:
1. **Density Estimation:** Assessing the probability assigned by the model to given data points.
2. **Sampling:** Generating novel data from the model distribution.
3. **Unsupervised Representation Learning:** Learning meaningful feature representations.

However, quantitatively evaluating generative models, particularly in terms of sampling and representation learning, remains a complex and active area of research.

## Conclusion

Deep generative models are a cornerstone in the field of AI, offering immense potential in understanding and creating complex data structures. As we delve deeper into these models, we encounter various challenges and questions, especially regarding model evaluation and the trade-offs in inference capabilities. Nonetheless, the journey through the world of generative models promises a fascinating exploration of AI's capabilities in mimicking and extending human-level pattern recognition and reasoning.
