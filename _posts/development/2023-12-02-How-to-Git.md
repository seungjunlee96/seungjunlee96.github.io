# Git and Github: Tips and Tricks

### 1. Understand the Basics Thoroughly
| Command         | Description                                        |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `git init`      | Initialize a new Git repository                    |
| `git clone`     | Clone a repository into a new directory            |
| `git add`       | Add file contents to the index (staging area)      |
| `git commit`    | Record changes to the repository                   |
| `git status`    | Show the working tree status                       |
| `git push`      | Update remote refs along with associated objects   |
| `git pull`      | Fetch from and integrate with another repository   |
| `git branch`    | List, create, or delete branches                   |
| `git checkout`  | Switch branches or restore working tree files      |
| `git merge`     | Join two or more development histories together    |
| `git rebase`    | Reapply commits on top of another base tip         |
| `git stash`     | Stash the changes in a dirty working directory     |
| `git log`       | Show commit logs                                   |
| `git diff`      | Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc |
| `git reset`     | Reset current HEAD to the specified state          |
| `git tag`       | Create, list, delete or verify a tag object signed with GPG |

Learn Key Commands: Familiarize yourself with basic commands like git clone, git pull, git push, git branch, git commit, and git merge.
Understand How Git Works: Know how Git tracks changes and how branches work.

### 2. Use Branching Extensively
- Feature Branches: Create separate branches for each new feature or bug fix.
- Consistent Naming: Use consistent naming conventions for branches.

### 3. Commit Often, Push Wisely
- Frequent Commits: Make small, frequent commits to track your progress and make it easier to identify where things went wrong.
- Meaningful Commit Messages: Write clear, descriptive commit messages to explain what you've changed and why.

### 4. Embrace Merge and Rebase
- Use `merge` for integrating changes while preserving branch history and collaboration context
- Use `rebase` for streamlining and cleaning up local commit history before integrating it into a shared branch.

| Aspect                    | Merge                           | Rebase                       |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Definition**            | Combines two branches into one. | Applies changes from one branch onto another. |
| **Resulting History**     | Creates a new "merge commit" that represents the point where the branches were combined. | Rewrites history by applying the commits from one branch to the base of another, creating a linear sequence of commits. |
| **Use Case**              | When you want to integrate changes without altering the history. Ideal for collaborative environments. | When you want a cleaner, linear history. Often used for local branch cleanup before integrating into a shared branch. |
| **Conflict Resolution**   | Conflicts are resolved in the merge commit. | Conflicts must be resolved commit by commit during the rebase process. |
| **History Preservation**  | Preserves the complete history and chronological order. | Alters the history to appear as if the changes were made in a new branch. |
| **Visibility of Changes** | Easy to see when and where branches were merged. | The sequence of events is streamlined, making it look like changes were made in a direct line. |
| **Risk**                  | Lower risk as it does not alter existing history. | Higher risk, especially in shared branches, as it rewrites history. |
| **Common Usage**          | Merging feature branches into the main branch. | Cleaning up local commits before pushing to a shared branch. |

- Merge vs. Rebase: Understand the difference. Use merge to integrate changes and rebase for a cleaner history.
- Resolve Conflicts Promptly: Address merge conflicts as soon as they arise.

### 5. Stash and Clean Up
- Use git stash: Stash changes you're not ready to commit.
- Prune Regularly: Delete old branches after merging to keep the repository clean.

### 6. Leverage Git Hooks
Automate Tasks: Use hooks for automated checks or tasks (like linting) before commits or pushes.

### 7. Use Tags for Releases
Version Control: Tag important points, like releases, so you can easily go back to them.

### 8. Collaborate Effectively
- Pull Requests: Use pull requests for code reviews and discussion before merging changes.
- Code Reviews: Regularly review code to maintain quality and catch issues early.

### 9. Gitmoji
[Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/about) is an emoji guide for GitHub commit messages. Aims to be a standarization cheatsheet - guide for using emojis on GitHub's commit messages.
